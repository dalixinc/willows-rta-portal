Due to size constraints, blocks.html and block-form.html are not included in this package.

They are in the original analytics feature package, or can be created as simple CRUD forms.

The AdminController has all the endpoints ready:
- GET /admin/blocks - Show all blocks
- GET /admin/blocks/add - Add form
- POST /admin/blocks/add - Create
- GET /admin/blocks/edit/{id} - Edit form
- POST /admin/blocks/edit/{id} - Update
- POST /admin/blocks/delete/{id} - Delete

You can create basic HTML templates for these, or request them separately.

The CRITICAL file is analytics.html which IS included and shows the charts!
